# Traffic Analysis and Prediction

Traffic is pretty awful in Austin. If you have experienced it before you know what I am talking about. Our time is wasted by Mopac and Lamar during rush-hour and I-35... seemingly all of the time. My goal with this project is to make life a little faster from A to B.

I will acknowledge, solving this problem seems impossible. Nevethless, I do not think that should keep anyone from trying. In this project, I will use the latest Data Analysis technologies and Product Management principles to create something I am proud of, and perhaps something that could save me an hour or two a week. Traffic is a universal problem we all face and is deemed a public nuisance. Spiderman would be on the case... but he's not real. Sorry.

Above this description you will find 10 sections. The project is described in such a manner because it documents my progress and reflects real world product development (at least one "cycle" of it). I come from an Economics education and find that companies need to sell something valuable, so I thought why not create something valuable as if I were a company. Maybe that way an organization might hire me to create or improve another product in a similar manner ($$$). Anyway, the sections are

### 1. Find a problem

I found my problem pretty quickly. I don't like traffic. It is a waste of time and a massive economic loss for many individuals in Austin who could be doing other things with their time... unless you like a quiet space to listen to your podcasts or audiobooks.

### 2. Write out Solutions

This document and the remaining documents will be github README files for you viewership. They contain a documentation of this little journey of mine. I will have my steps, some of my thoughts, and Jupyter Notebooks that document what has been done and some avenues I chose to not pursue.

### 3. Create an MVP

This section illustrates the creation of the MVP (Minimal Viable Product), or the smallest little feable version of solving my problem that I could come up with to hit the ground running.

### 4. Evaluate "MOSCOW"

MOSCOW is an acryonym for "Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have". In this document, I stage the ideas in the intuitive sections. I got this acronym from a youtube video and thought it would be cool to try out.

### 5. Wire Framing

In the Wire Framing document I will use Figma to create the outline for the user experience and all the technical goodness that it may involve.

### 6. Build Prototype

In building the prototype, I use Jira to document that tasks that need to be done. There will be screen shots that I will include to display that I did in fact use it. In the industry I recognize this sort of project management is necessary with HUGE projects. Even though this project is small, I figure that this is a great oppurtunity to practice staying organized so that I can work well with teams on bigger projects.

### 7. Conduct User Interview

These user interviews will be a bit informal. I talk to friends and family and simply ask them what they think. Of course, I am going to do a bit of data capture and analysis because I like that sort of thing. Then, I will find the most desired new features and repeat the MOSCOW step to determine what I "must have, should have, could have and won't have".

### 8. Build Version 2!

Here I will work on another variation of the project, improving on my original design and implementing the user feedback. I recognize that this is a never ending process of products in the "real world".

### 9. Publish Product

Here I will explore the idea of publishing the project. If the end design ends up being something simply to host of GitHub, so be it. In the most technical boundary, I will try to host the product on it's own website or even consider a mobile application.

### 10. Conclusion

Here I wrap up my thought and any analysis insights that I have found. I'm not totally sure how in depth this will be but I think that there definetly will be at least one or two interesting things as "takeaways".
